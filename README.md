# DESIGN-REPORT-FOR-AEROTHON-2024
This design report illustrates the innovative steps Team Arrow undertook in developing Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) in preparation for the AEROTHON 2024 competition

In this competition our team’s hard work and dedication have led us to First Prize and the award for Best Business Plan Proposal at Aerothon 2024, held at GITAM University, Bengaluru, in November 2024! We were honored with a prize of ₹1.75 lakhs, a testament to our collective efforts and innovative approach. The journey began in June 2024, when we cleared Phase 1 of the competition. From there, it was a rollercoaster ride—designing, prototyping, and refining our drone to meet the rigorous requirements. As the Team Lead, I had the privilege of working alongside an exceptional group of individuals who brought creativity, resilience, and passion to every step of the process. Together, we developed a UAV capable of autonomous navigation, payload delivery, and efficient surveying.
